`PyCondor
<https://github.com/jrbourbeau/pycondor/>`_ (Python HTCondor) is a tool to help build and submit HTCondor jobs in a straight-forward manner with minimal hassle.

With just a few lines of code, you can get PyCondor up and running:

.. code-block:: python

    import pycondor
    job = pycondor.Job(name='examplejob',
                       executable='my_script.py')
    job.build_submit()


==========
Motivation
==========
`HTCondor <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/>`_ is a an open-source workload management system for high-throughput computing tasks developed at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

PyCondor is a tool to help streamline this job submission process through a user-friendly API and built-in functionality to automate common tasks.
